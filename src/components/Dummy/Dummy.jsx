        <h1> We are completely offline & we like to keep it that way.</h1>
        <br />
        <h1>  Travel Agents approach us with their request & then take our suggestions in picking the right luxury resorts for their clients. We first understand the end client’s profile & only then recommend a fitting resort.</h1> <br /> 
        <h1>Not many B2B companies are equipped to do that!</h1> <br /><br />


        <h1>We never source from alternate booking channels such as DMCs or Online Systems. Our booking are always made directly with the hotels.</h1> <br />
        <h1>   We are also the only B2B company that says ‘No’ to business. We believe in our partner hotels & we don't sell any hotel that is not contracted with us.  Snooty? Nah...Being Focused is more “our thing”!</h1> <br /> <br />


        <h1>Apart from servicing some of the established luxury travel companies, we also support & encourage new travel companies who wish to enter into the luxury travel space. We coach them, train them & empower them to up-sell. </h1> <br />
        <h1>  Some like to call us the “Robinhood” of Travel...& We don’t really mind that!</h1> <br /><br />
